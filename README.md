## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--

I am currently a teacher at the Multimediadesign education in Copenhagen. I have been a teacher there for 22 years. For a decade I tought the International classes, but as we do not have those anymore, I now teach Danish classes only.

My main focus is coding from HTML and CSS to JavaScript. Used to do PHP and database design back when we did backend stuff. Now we're focused on frontend techs, so that's what I do the most. Looking into some Python at the moment.

Also looking onto some media law and internet security as part of my work, as this has become increasingly important for new web developers to know about.

Most of my time besides work is spend behind keys, strings and knobs in my home studio [find me on Spoitify or Bandcamp as "Dull Fantastique" or "The Black Soil Project"] or developing an RPG (called "Rebels") with a small group of other devotees. Meet us on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rebels_RPG/).

I also have quite a few other projects going on, but hardly any time left - khhh!
